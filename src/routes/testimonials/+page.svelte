			I continue to move forward in this world.Tasha, you are one of only a handful of extraordinary
			human beings that can even attempt to do this type of work. You are so special and I am deeply

			experience I longed for after being in more sterile “parent loss groups” since my Apá got sick
			and then died. I learned so many lessons and wonderful wisdom from Tasha. If you ever have the
			opportunity to be with her in her offerings, please do. Thank you, Tasha for being a teacher
			to me in my very heavy grief.”

			just better. For anyone working with and through grief, I’d highly recommend sitting in on a

			your love. For anyone grieving, this is an opportunity your soul is calling for. Nurture your
			grief, you deserve it.’”

			Grief is different for everyone and it's a forever ongoing energy that ebbs, flows and
			constantly changes. Tasha led us through a beautiful ceremony where we were all held, heard
			and seen in a safe and inclusive space . Her empathy and deep passion for this work was
			evident. I am so grateful for the opportunity to work with her and the others in our circle
			and would completely recommend her work to anyone experiencing loss or grief of any kind.”

			beautiful circle. Every moment was a new experience but felt like a familiar home that I had
			been longing for. The work was extremely heavy but I never felt so light after the closing
			ceremony. I would do this work over and over again. Tasha created such a safe space and
			welcomed each of us in with open arms. We invited the mothers to sit with us and I haven’t
			felt that close to my mom in many moons. All of our mothers were there and I now feel closer
			than ever to her. I showed up alone and left with many sisters. Thank you Tasha, you are going
			to continue to heal the world, one soul at a time.”

			“Tasha tends to my grief— she does. I first connected with her about a month after my mama
			died. I was in the first trimester of pregnancy, and feeling overall nauseous and uncentered,
			ripped open and raw. Having her video calls scheduled was one of the touchstones that helped
			pull me through the weeks in an otherwise upheaved blur of time. Where so many of my
			well-intended friends dodged talking about my mama, didn’t want to bring her or her death up,
			as to avoid my tears, wanted me to stay in the sunshine, Tasha held space for me to tell her
			anything and everything that came to mind regarding my mother’s passing, daily life without
			her, some random perfect memory of her, anything. There is something so simple yet exactly
			right about actually looking at death, holding eye contact with it, even if it makes us
			uncomfortable. I needed that so much, to have someone look at this death with me, and just sit
			with that. In those first tender months of mother loss, I felt so seen and held by Tasha. She
			had words for me when I had none. She was familiar with the terrain where I was a stumbling
			foreigner. Having just lost my main woman on this planet, my daily person to check in with and
			be held by, it felt so very important to find Tasha, someone to be seen by, someone to check
			in on me. I feel proud of myself for having enough energy to reach out for a lifeline when I
			felt the surges of this perfect storm swallowing me. Something as simple as someone holding
			space and allowing grief. Allowing it. And acknowledging it. As the months have turned into
			the better part of a year, I have continued to rely on my communications with Tasha as a safe
			and assured place to openly share about my mother loss process. A buoy in the sea of grief. I
			am grateful for her guidance as a learn to love my mother in this new reality and dimension.
			She has guided me to redefine the potential boundaries of my relationship to my mama, no
			longer in flesh and the physical, but as an ancestor, a guardian so deeply connected to me
			from anther realm. ”
