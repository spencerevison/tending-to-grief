	<p>WHEN WE BYPASS GRIEF, WE BYPASS LOVE- SO LETS BE WITH IT, SHALL WE?</p>

	<p>
		What does “tending to grief” mean? It means so many things and looks so many ways. But some of
		my definitions include: Showing up in true presence to sit at the altar of loss and sorrow. It
		means making time and space for what is yearning to be felt. For these immense losses to be
		acknowledged. Tending to grief means making this a practice and an honoring. To grow into a new
		relationship with your beloved dead. To remember them, to carry them forward.
	</p>

	<p>
		Tending to grief means letting go of the dominant cultural lie we continuously are fed that we
		need to let go of these people and that death and grief is something we are meant to just “get
		over”. It means carving out intentional time to connect with them. To go into the landscape of
		your memory, study the lines on the faces of the ones that you loved so dear and invite them to
		reveal themselves now in other ways. It means allowing your tears to fall and fertilize the
		soil, the land, the rivers, and oceans that are near. To call upon the earth and the land to
		hold you.
	</p>

	<p>
		Tending to grief means to recognize the preciousness and the greatness of your love. It means to
		light a candle in the dark. To be in the marrow and bones of your heartbreak for it is simply a
		reflection of your profound, unconditional, love.
	</p>

	<p>
		It means being held in your joy and your love for life because you are intimately connected with
		the fact that it is all so fleeting and impermanent. Tending to grief is to be open to the
		immense suffering and impermanence that this life has promised us. And to the boundless
		graciousness and beauty of it too.
	</p>

	<p>I hope you will join me here on the journey With great love, and great grief</p>
	<p>xoxo</p>
